## Resumo
Apesar de práticas de minimo impacto ambiental fazerem parte do programa educativo proposto pelos Escoteiros do Brasil e regulamentado através do POR, a falta de conhecimento sobre essas práticas pelo Escotistas e a falta de apoio de formação pelos Dirigentes mantém os escotismo brasileiro desatualizado em relação  às práticas mais eficientes, reconhecidas internacionalmente. Essa falta de atualização promove ações de alto impacto degradando o meio ambiente e ferindo a imagem do movimento escoteiro como agente de preservação. Este artigo visa contextualizar e esclarecer a instuição, escotista e dirigentes sobre as práticas atualizadas de mínimo impacto ambiental quando realizando atividades ao ar-livre.

## Prefacio

Escoteiro desde de os 11 anos passei muitos anos de minha vida escoteira promovendo a prática de "técnicas mateiras", tão queridas e estimadas, passadas de geração em geração pelos Chefes Escoteiros, remontando os primórdios do escotismo até os primeiros ensinamentos de B.P. publicados no saudoso Escotismo para Rapazes.

Porém após iniciar os trabalhos como Escotista, um novo mundo se abriu onde seria necessário estudar sobre objetivos educacionais, programa educativo, coompreensão do comportamento dos jovens da sociedade atual, sendo praticamente infinito o material a se estudar.

Nesse novo contexto, fui buscar ajuda de um grande amigo de infância que nunca ouvera perdido seu espírito escoteiro, escalador, montanhista, biólogo, Paul Colas, comentou sobre algumas prátricas que havia tido contato enquanto praticava algumas expedições com escaladores e montanhistas, um tal de conceito de "práticas de mínimo impacto ambiental" chamado "Pega Leve!".

A partir daí nada mais seria como antes muitas conversas aconteceram onde discutimos o quanto as práticas do escotismo brasileiro ficaram paradas no tempo, e iniciamos um processo de incluir esse novo conceito nas atividades do Grupo Escoteiro Piratinis.

Ao buscar mais material sobre o assunto tive contato com pessoas como Antonio Calvo, da OBB e outros materiais onde tive contato com o material original que formalizava internacionalmente todo esses novos conceitos, chamado "Leave No Trace".

Em 2014 assumi a função de Chefe de Seção da Tropa Senior e em junho realizei o Curso Avançado do Ramo Senior. A cabeça estava fervilhando com as informações e pessoas maralvilhosas que pude trocar muitas ideias.

Ainda 2014 afim de me aperfeiçoar tecnicamente para prover atividades com masi segurança para o Ramo Senior, fiz o Curso Básico de Montanhismo do Clube Alpino Paulista, onde tive mais uma vez contato com os conceitos do Pega Leve! e com alguns montanhistas que também teriam sido escoteiros. Conversando com membros do Clube e colegas de curso, percebi algo interessante, muitos dos montanhistas que foram escoteiros, não diziam que eram escoteiros abertamente, devido a imagem que os movimento escoteiro possui fora de nossa instituição. Para minha surpresa, não somos vistos como pessoas preocupadas com o meio ambiente em atividades ao ar-livre, mas sim completamente o oposto. Fogueiras e acampamentos em locais inapropriados, uso indiscriminado e recursos naturais, grandes e barulhentos grupos que não se preocupam com incomodar as demais pessoas a suas volta, degradação dos locais em que passam. Essa é a visão do movimento escoteiro das pessoas que compartilham os mesmos locais de atividades com os escoteiros.

Isso foi um impacto muito grande em toda minha concepção e percepção sobre o movimento escoteiro. E decidi que algo precisava ser feito, não mais a nível local, mas que esses conceitos fossem divulgados e chegasse mais longe.

Esses conceitos criaram uma quebra de paradigma na minha forma de enxergar as práticas ensinadas e desenvolvidas pelo escotismo. Espero que este material possa ser de utilidade para escotistas e dirigentes que querem dar um passo a mais em direção a uma instituição preocupada com o que ensina aos mais jovens.

## Escotismo e Mínimo Impacto Ambiental

Desde de 2013 já foi incluído no POR de forma muito enfática a preocupação com as práticas de mínimo impacto ambiental:

> **REGRA 140 – ORIENTAÇÃO GERAL SOBRE SEGURANÇA**
> XII - Os responsáveis pela organização de uma atividade escoteira ao ar livre devem revesti-la de todas as iniciativas e providências necessárias para garantir o mínimo impacto ambiental e fazer com que todos os envolvidos tenham uma atitude de conservação do meio ambiente. [^por140xii]

## Não Deixe Rastros

The Leave No Trace principles might seem unimportant until you consider the combined effects of millions of outdoor visitors. One poorly located campsite or campfire may have little significance, but thousands of such instances seriously degrade the outdoor experience for all. Leaving no trace is everyone's responsibility.

Leave No Trace Awareness
Instilling values in young people and preparing them to make moral and ethical choices throughout their lifetime is the mission of the Boy Scouts of America. Leave No Trace helps reinforce that mission, and reminds us to respect the rights of other users of the outdoors as well as future generations. Appreciation for our natural environment and a knowledge of the interrelationships of nature bolster our respect and reverence toward the environment and nature.
Leave No Trace is an awareness and an attitude rather than a set of rules. It applies in your backyard or local park as much as in the backcountry. We should all practice Leave No Trace in our thinking and actions--wherever we go.
We learn Leave No Trace by sharing the principles and then discovering how they can be applied. Leave No Trace instills an awareness that spurs questions like "What can we do to reduce our impact on the environment and on the experiences of other visitors?" Use your judgment and experience to tailor camping and hiking practices to the environment where the outing will occur. Forest, mountain, seashore, plains, freshwater, and wetland environments all require different minimum impact practices.
Outdoor Ethics
Help protect the backcountry by remembering that while you are there, you are a visitor. When you visit a friend, you take care to leave your friend's home just as you found it. You would never think of trampling garden flowers, chopping down trees in the yard, putting soap in the drinking water, or marking your name on the living room wall. When you visit the backcountry, the same courtesies apply. Leave everything just as you found it.
Hiking and camping without a trace are signs of an expert outdoorsman, and of a Scout or Scouter who cares for the environment. Travel lightly on the land.
Leave No Trace Training
The Boy Scouts of America is committed to implementing Leave No Trace at all levels of the program. Earning the BSA Leave No Trace Achievement Award could set the stage for starting on a comprehensive Leave No Trace training continuum:
Advanced training is available for Master Educators, the top Leave No Trace instructors.
Master Educators teach Trainers, the second level of instructors.
Trainers and Master Educators conduct awareness workshops, which are designed to promote Leave No Trace.
Through a cooperative agreement with the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, the BSA is actively placing Master Educators in every council and Trainers in every district.
Master Educator Courses
The five-day Master Educator course is designed for people who are actively teaching outdoor skills or providing recreation information to the public. This valuable training is recognized throughout the world by the outdoors industry, land management agencies, and the outdoor recreation community. Master Educators can train others in Leave No Trace skills as well as facilitate Leave No Trace Trainer courses and awareness workshops.
Trainer Courses
Leave No Trace Trainer courses are two-day trainings taught by Master Educators in the outdoors. Trainer courses are designed to help participants better understand and teach Leave No Trace skills and ethics.
Awareness Workshops
Awareness workshops can include any type of formal Leave No Trace training that is one day or less in length. These presentations may be anything from 30-minute chats about the Leave No Trace principles to full-day workshops.
The Principles of Leave No Trace
1. Plan Ahead and Prepare
Proper trip planning and preparation helps hikers and campers accomplish trip goals safely and enjoyably while minimizing damage to natural and cultural resources. Campers who plan ahead can avoid unexpected situations, and minimize their impact by complying with area regulations such as observing limitations on group size. Schedule your trek to avoid times of high use. Obtain permits or permission to use the area for your trek.
Proper planning ensures
Low-risk adventures because campers obtained information concerning geography and weather and prepared accordingly
Properly located campsites because campers allotted enough time to reach their destination
Appropriate campfires and minimal trash because of careful meal planning and food repackaging and proper equipment
Comfortable and fun camping and hiking experiences because the outing matches the skill level of the participants
2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
Damage to land occurs when visitors trample vegetation or communities of organisms beyond recovery. The resulting barren areas develop into undesirable trails, campsites, and soil erosion.
Concentrate Activity, or Spread Out?
In high-use areas, campers should concentrate their activities where vegetation is already absent. Minimize resource damage by using existing trails and selecting designated or existing campsites. Keep campsites small by arranging tents in close proximity.
In more remote, less-traveled areas, campers should generally spread out. When hiking, take different paths to avoid creating new trails that cause erosion. When camping, disperse tents and cooking activities--and move camp daily to avoid creating permanent-looking campsites. Avoid places where impacts are just beginning to show. Always choose the most durable surfaces available: rock, gravel, sand, compacted soil, dry grasses, or snow.
These guidelines apply to most alpine settings and may be different for other areas, such as deserts. Learn the Leave No Trace techniques for your crew's specific activity or destination. Check with land managers to be sure of the proper technique.
3. Dispose of Waste Properly (Pack It In, Pack It Out)
This simple yet effective saying motivates back-country visitors to take their trash home with them. It makes sense to carry out of the backcountry the extra materials taken there by your group or others. Inspect your campsite for trash or spilled foods. Accept the challenge of packing out all trash, leftover food, and litter.
Sanitation
Backcountry users create body waste and wastewater that require proper disposal.
Wastewater. Help prevent contamination of natural water sources: After straining food particles, properly dispose of dishwater by dispersing at least 200 feet (about 80 to 100 strides for a youth) from springs, streams, and lakes. Use biodegradable soap 200 feet or more from any water source.
Human Waste. Proper human waste disposal helps prevent the spread of disease and exposure to others. Catholes 6 to 8 inches deep in humus and 200 feet from water, trails, and campsites are often the easiest and most practical way to dispose of feces.
4. Leave What You Find
Allow others a sense of discovery, and preserve the past. Leave rocks, plants, animals, archaeological artifacts, and other objects as you find them. Examine but do not touch cultural or historical structures and artifacts. It may be illegal to remove artifacts.
Minimize Site Alterations
Do not dig tent trenches or build lean-tos, tables, or chairs. Never hammer nails into trees, hack at trees with hatchets or saws, or damage bark and roots by tying horses to trees for extended periods. Replace surface rocks or twigs that you cleared from the campsite. On high-impact sites, clean the area and dismantle inappropriate user-built facilities such as multiple fire rings and log seats or tables.
Good campsites are found, not made. Avoid altering a site, digging trenches, or building structures.
5. Minimize Campfire Impacts
Some people would not think of camping without a campfire. Yet the naturalness of many areas has been degraded by overuse of fires and increasing demand for firewood.
Lightweight camp stoves make low-impact camping possible by encouraging a shift away from fires. Stoves are fast, eliminate the need for firewood, and make cleanup after meals easier. After dinner, enjoy a candle lantern instead of a fire.
If you build a fire, the most important consideration is the potential for resource damage. Whenever possible, use an existing campfire ring in a well-placed campsite. Choose not to have a fire in areas where wood is scarce--at higher elevations, in heavily used areas with a limited wood supply, or in desert settings.
True Leave No Trace fires are small. Use dead and downed wood that can be broken easily by hand. When possible, burn all wood to ash and remove all unburned trash and food from the fire ring. If a site has two or more fire rings, you may dismantle all but one and scatter the materials in the surrounding area. Be certain all wood and campfire debris is dead out.
6. Respect Wildlife
Quick movements and loud noises are stressful to animals. Considerate campers practice these safety methods:
Observe wildlife from afar to avoid disturbing them.
Give animals a wide berth, especially during breeding, nesting, and birthing seasons.
Store food securely and keep garbage and food scraps away from animals so they will not acquire bad habits. Never feed wildlife. Help keep wildlife wild.
You are too close if an animal alters its normal activities.
7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors
Thoughtful campers respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience.
Travel and camp in small groups (no more than the group size prescribed by land managers).
Let nature's sounds prevail. Keep the noise down and leave radios, tape players, and pets at home.
Select campsites away from other groups to help preserve their solitude.
Always travel and camp quietly to avoid disturbing other visitors.
Make sure the colors of clothing and gear blend with the environment.
Respect private property and leave gates (open or closed) as found.
Be considerate of other campers and respect their privacy.

Welcome to StackEdit!
===================


Hey! I'm your first Markdown document in **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

----------


Documents
-------------

StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

> **Note:**

> - StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
> - Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
> - Clearing your browser's data may **delete all your local documents!** Make sure your documents are synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** (check out the [<i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronization](#synchronization) section).

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create a document

The document panel is accessible using the <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> button in the navigation bar. You can create a new document by clicking <i class="icon-file"></i> **New document** in the document panel.

#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Switch to another document

All your local documents are listed in the document panel. You can switch from one to another by clicking a document in the list or you can toggle documents using <kbd>Ctrl+[</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+]</kbd>.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Rename a document

You can rename the current document by clicking the document title in the navigation bar.

> **Tip:** Check out the [<i class="icon-upload"></i> Publish a document](#publish-a-document) section for a description of the different output formats.


----------


Synchronization
-------------------

StackEdit can be combined with <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** and <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** to have your documents saved in the *Cloud*. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.

> **Note:**

> - Full access to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can be configured in the settings.
> - Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.
> - If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Open a document

You can open a document from <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** or the <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Open from...**. Once opened, any modification in your document will be automatically synchronized with the file in your **Google Drive** / **Dropbox** account.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Save a document

You can save any document by opening the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu and by clicking **Save on...**. Even if your document is already synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations and accounts.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronize a document

Once your document is linked to a <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** or a <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** file, StackEdit will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be detected.

If you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button is disabled when you have no document to synchronize.

#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Manage document synchronization

Since one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Manage synchronization** in the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> **Synchronize** sub-menu. This will let you remove synchronization locations that are associated to your document.

> **Note:** If you delete the file from **Google Drive** or from **Dropbox**, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location.

----------


Publication
-------------

Once you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **Tumblr**, **WordPress** and on any SSH server.

You can publish your document by opening the <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Publish** sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:

- Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for example),
- Template, to have a full control of the output.

> **Note:** The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the **Advanced** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to update it. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the <i class="icon-upload"></i> button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The <i class="icon-upload"></i> button is disabled when your document has not been published yet.

#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Manage document publication

Since one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking <i class="icon-upload"></i> **Manage publication** in the <i class="icon-provider-stackedit"></i> menu panel. This will let you remove publication locations that are associated to your document.

> **Note:** If the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.

----------


Markdown Extra
--------------------

StackEdit supports **Markdown Extra**, which extends **Markdown** syntax with some nice features.

> **Tip:** You can disable any **Markdown Extra** feature in the **Extensions** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information about **Markdown** syntax [here][2] and **Markdown Extra** extension [here][3].


### Tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:

Item     | Value
-------- | ---
Computer | $1600
Phone    | $12
Pipe     | $1

You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |


### Definition Lists

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition A
:   Definition B

Term 3

:   Definition C

:   Definition D

	> part of definition D


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Prettify** syntax highlighting [here][5],
> - about **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting [here][6].


### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |


### Table of contents

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `[TOC]`:

[TOC]


### MathJax

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> **Tip:** To make sure mathematical expressions are rendered properly on your website, include **MathJax** into your template:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```

> **Note:** You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here][4].


### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Sequence diagrams** syntax [here][7],
> - about **Flow charts** syntax [here][8].
